      #Titanic Survival Prediction
      
This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on machine learning algorithms. The data for the project can be found on Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition. The data includes information about passengers such as their age, ticket class, fare, gender, and more.

      #Installation
      
The code requires opendatasets and the following dependencies:

pandas
matplotlib
numpy
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
joblib

      #Usage
      
The code downloads the Titanic data from Kaggle and then uses the pandas library to load the data into a dataframe. The data is then cleaned by handling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns. The data is then visualized to get an understanding of the target variable.

Next, multiple machine learning algorithms are trained on the data including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and XGBoost. The model with the highest accuracy score is then saved as a pickle file.

   #Contributions
Contributions and improvements to the code are welcome.
